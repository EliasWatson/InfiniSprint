# InfiniSprint
This is a [UMM](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/) mod for Risk of Rain 2.
It makes you constantly sprint so you no longer need to hit Ctrl all the time.

## Installation
### Install UMM
1. Download [UMM](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/) and extract to a folder (not the game folder)
2. Run UnityModManager.exe
3. Select "Risk of Rain 2"
4. Set the installation method to "Assembly"
5. Click install

If UMM is erroring when you start the game then you will need a dll from Unity:
1. If you have Unity installed, copy it from "Editor\Data\MonoBleedingEdge\lib\mono\4.5\mscorlib.dll"
2. If you do not have Unity installed then you will need to source this dll from somewhere else. I don't know if I'm legally allowed to distribute it
3. Copy that dll into "Risk of Rain 2\Risk of Rain 2_Data\Managed" and overwrite the existing file

### Install InfiniSprint
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/EliasWatson/InfiniSprint/releases/latest)
2. Navigate to the game folder
3. Extract InfiniSprint to the "Mods" folder
 
It should look like "Risk of Rain 2/Mods/InfiniSprint/InfiniSprint.dll"
